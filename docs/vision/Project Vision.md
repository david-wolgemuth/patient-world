# Project Vision

## Summary
A minimal autonomous simulation that runs indefinitely, evolves through interacting systems, and emphasizes emergent behavior over complex infrastructure.

## Goals
- Daily ticks via GitHub Actions keep the world alive without manual attention.
- Interlocking resources, agents, and feedback loops evolve independently.
- Interesting states and stories emerge without dedicated content creation.
- Direct interventions remain possible but never required for progress.

## Observations
- [goal] Autonomy and emergence hold higher value than realism or fidelity.
- [behavior] Tiny rule interactions should produce observable shifts over time.
- [constraint] The world must remain enjoyable to watch even after long breaks.

## Relations
- relates_to [[Desired Experience]]
- supports [[Architecture Principles (MVP-Level)]]
- inspires [[Core Features (The Fun Part)]]
