# Core Features (The Fun Part)

## Summary
Evolving agents, resources, weather, and factions interact across a tiny spatial canvas, producing feedback loops and slow narrative arcs without manual storytelling.

## Desired Features
- Agents with needs such as food, shelter, or energy that drive visible behavior.
- Resources that regenerate or deplete, introducing scarcity and recovery cycles.
- Minimal spatial representation (even a few tiles) enabling territory and movement.
- Event hooks for weather, disruptions, or factional conflicts.
- Feedback loops that can stabilize, spiral, or surprise across many ticks.

## Observations
- [interest] Micro-ecologies and small colonies spark long-term curiosity.
- [pattern] Systems must interact so the world “writes its own story.”
- [scope] Slow evolution keeps attention without requiring constant input.

## Relations
- elaborates [[Project Vision]]
- derives_from [[Desired Experience]]
- influenced_by [[Architecture Principles (MVP-Level)]]
