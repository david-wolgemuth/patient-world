# Constraints That Matter Most

## Summary
The project must remain light, immediately functional, expandable on weekends, and never feel like infrastructure grind or content labor.

## Constraints
- Ship a working loop on day one so progress feels real.
- Keep every expansion within a weekend or shorter burst.
- Avoid features that drag the work into maintenance jobs or heavy content pipelines.
- Preserve a playful vibe that is easy to return to after downtime.
