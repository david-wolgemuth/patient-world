# Preferred Development Approach

## Summary
Momentum starts with a single working loop, features are added only when curiosity demands, and simple tools (Python, JSON, GitHub Actions, Git) keep iteration lightweight.

## Development Preferences
- Begin with `sim.py` as the entire system and extend gradually.
- Use Git branches for experimentation and GitHub Actions for the autonomous prod tick.
- Treat JSON or SQLite as sufficient storage until real pressure emerges.
- Avoid scaffolding, engines, or versioning schemes that delay hands-on play.

## Observations
- [practice] End-to-end functionality on day one matters more than architectural purity.
- [tooling] Git and Actions already cover versioning, automation, and promotion.
- [principle] Structure should be added only when pain appears, never in anticipation.

## Relations
- derives_from [[Desired Experience]]
- enables [[Architecture Principles (MVP-Level)]]
- supports [[Constraints That Matter Most]]
